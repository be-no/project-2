# app idea and purpose
Imagine an application that catalogues food by taste (e.g. sweet, sour, savory). I wanted to create this app for people like me who had pictures of ethnic dishes but don't know the English translation.

# user stories
As a Viet food enthusiast, I want to keep track of all the Viet foods my family cooks so that I can revisit my favorite meals.

# goals for future enhancements
- Google Translate API to try translating the name of a dish to English
- Multer to allow users to upload a corresponding picture of their Vietnamese dish
- CSS framework for more personalized styling
